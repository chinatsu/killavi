With a lot of inspiration taken from [aviglitch](https://github.com/ucnv/aviglitch), I've tried my hand at messing with AVI files, except in Python instead of Ruby. I suppose I intend on implementing the things aviglitch does, but for now I just want it to work.

I'll split things up... later, probably.
